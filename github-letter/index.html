                    <p>I live in Florida with my wife and cat. I'm a Rubyist, frontender, Cocoa developer, and sometimes a designer. I've been making software professionally for about 6 years. </p>

                            <dd>At <a href="http://www.spatialnetworks.com">Spatial Networks</a>, a geospatial company here in Tampa Bay, I worked within a very small team to create the REST API, Rails app, and iOS client of the first versions of what is now called <a href="http://fulcrumapp.com/">Fulcrum</a>, a flexible POI collection tool. This is where my love of Ruby blossomed, where I wrote my first line of Objective-C, where I discovered that <a class="tip image" href="img/map-projections.png">map projections</a> are <a class="tip image" href="img/mindblown.gif">mind-blowing</a>, and where we chose MongoDB to store the app's highly heterogeneous data.</dd>

                            <dd>I went on to work remotely at <a href="http://www.zaarly.com">Zaarly</a>, an SF-based startup creating a marketplace where people can make money doing what they love. Here I worked on their JavaScript-heavy frontend, put together their <a href="http://hammer.zaarly.com" title="Hate fantasy metal and dragons? Don't click here!">CSS styleguide</a> with my <a href="https://github.com/brentd/kss">fork of KSS</a> (thanks <b>@kneath</b>!), worked on the iOS app, and built their peer-to-peer payments system using <a href="http://balancedpayments.com">Balanced</a>. Oh, and I became addicted to Blue Bottle, being that there's one <a href="http://vimeo.com/50238848" title="Timelapse footage from Blue Bottle cam →">right next door</a> to their office.</dd>

                            <dd>Around 8 months ago I began freelancing, and ended up going from contract to full-time with the great folks at <a href="http://www.kajabi.com">Kajabi</a>, a bootstrapped &amp; profitable company specializing in products for Internet marketers. Most recently we shipped the freshly minted <a href="http://www.megaphoneapp.com">Megaphone</a>, an app that enables painless creation of inbound marketing pages.</dd>

                    <p>In short, I am a well-rounded software engineer with experience across the spectrum of modern web and mobile development, frontend to backend. I prefer it this way&mdash;I find it immensely satisfying to be able to take an idea from the back of a napkin, through data modeling, UI design, and code, and end up with a beautiful, functional piece of software.</p>

                    <p>Lately, things have been great. While creating software is still my passion, I admit that I no longer spend <a class="tip image" href="img/edo.gif">12+ hours a day</a> in front of my laptop. Within the past year I’ve taken up guitar, a foreign language, cooking, cycling, and yoga. I'm not particularly good at any of these things yet, but I have fun thinking of myself as a sort of <a class="tip image" href="img/standing-cat.gif">crappy renaissance man</a>.</p>

                    <p>It seems I've finally achieved a great work/life balance. But despite this, it feels like something is missing.</p>

                    <p>Not long ago <a href="https://github.com/brentd/xray-rails" title="github.com/brentd/xray-rails →">I created Xray</a>, a Rails development tool that scratches an itch I've had for a long time, and I can't stop thinking about more. I <a class="tip image" href="img/skytower.jpg">dream</a> of <a class="tip image" href="img/1920_clouds.jpg">futuristic light tables</a> for developers (<a class="tip image" href="img/acer.png">yes, seriously</a>), a <a class="tip image" href="img/editor.jpg">text editor</a> that integrates with Git and GitHub in ways that <a class="tip image" href="img/blame.jpg" data-caption="I think we can do better.">tacked-on plugins</a> can't, or just simple ways to improve the <a class="tip image" href="img/github-mac.png" data-caption="Great.

                    <p><b>I want to work on what I dream about.</b></p>

                    <p>The most empowering thing I find about being a developer is that we're able to craft the tools we use every day. As a community, we're in complete control of whether or not we're as effective&mdash;and happy&mdash;as we can be when making software.</p>

                    <p><b>And that's why GitHub makes me smile:</b> GitHub creates, and is the home of, most of the tools I use daily to be a better, happier developer, and the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kneath/building-an-army-of-robots" title='"Building an Army of Robots" by @kneath →'>internal tools you've built</a> show that you understand how important tooling really is. To me, GitHub stands for the idea that with the right tools, through collaboration and constant improvement, together we can create a better <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/04/ff_andreessen/5/" title='"Software is Eating the World" →'>world of software</a>, and maybe <a href="http://government.github.com/" title="government.github.com →">even more</a>.</p>

                    <p>Truth be told, the only other company that has captured my heart the way GitHub has is Apple. GitHub didn't <i>invent</i> open source or version control, but like Apple's products, it's hard to imagine where we'd be without GitHub's vision and execution of those ideas.</p>

                    <p>I want to to refocus my career on building the tools of the future that make other software creators smile, and I can't imagine a better place to do that than within GitHub's <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works/" title='"How GitHub Works" by @holman →'>famous culture</a> of doers.</p>

                        <p>To date, I have been a generalist&mdash;at GitHub, I'd be very interested in developing for Mac or iOS projects. I'd love to talk about GitHub for Mac, or learn where I can pitch in on some Mac-related open source projects that are meaningful to that team.</p>

                        <p>However, I would love to make a connection with anyone at GitHub. Say hi!</p>
